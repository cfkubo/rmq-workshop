# üöÄ RabbitMQ on Kubernetes: Your Fun, Hands-On Adventure! üê∞üì¶

Hey there, fellow tech explorers! üëã Ready to dive into the world of messaging queues and Kubernetes? Buckle up, because this workshop is your ticket to getting your hands delightfully dirty with OSS RabbitMQ running like a charm on K8s!

## üó∫Ô∏è Your Treasure Map: Cloning the Repo

First things first, let's snag the treasure chest of code we'll be using. Open up your terminal and type these magical incantations:

```
git clone [https://github.com/cfkubo/rmq-workshop](https://github.com/cfkubo/rmq-workshop)
cd rmq-workshop/k8s
```
Boom! You've got the code. Now, let's navigate to the k8s folder where all the Kubernetes goodies are hiding.

## üõ†Ô∏è Laying the Foundation: Installing the RabbitMQ Operator
Think of the RabbitMQ Operator as your friendly K8s assistant, making sure your RabbitMQ clusters are healthy and happy. Let's get this helpful buddy installed on your Kubernetes cluster (any K8s will do!):


```
kubectl apply -f "[https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/releases/latest/download/cluster-operator.yml](https://github.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/releases/latest/download/cluster-operator.yml)"

```

This command tells Kubernetes to apply the configuration for the RabbitMQ Cluster Operator. It's like telling your K8s, "Hey, keep an eye out for RabbitMQ needs!"

To make sure our assistant arrived safely, let's peek at the namespaces:


```
kubectl get namespaces
```

You should see something like this in the output, and the important line here is rabbitmq-system ‚Äì that's where our operator is chilling:

```
NAME              STATUS   AGE
default           Active   73s
kube-node-lease   Active   73s
kube-public       Active   73s
kube-system       Active   73s
rabbitmq-system   Active   2s
```

## üêá Single and Ready to Mingle: Deploying a Single-Node RabbitMQ Cluster
Sometimes, you just need a solo RabbitMQ instance to get started. Let's deploy a simple, single-node cluster:

```
kubectl apply -f [https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/main/docs/examples/hello-world/rabbitmq.yaml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rabbitmq/cluster-operator/main/docs/examples/hello-world/rabbitmq.yaml)
```

Kubernetes is now off to create our RabbitMQ pod. Let's see if it's up and hopping:

```
kubectl get po
```

You should see a pod named something like hello-world-server-0 in the Running state:

```
NAME                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-server-0   1/1     Running   0          3m19s
```

To get a more RabbitMQ-centric view, let's ask the operator about our cluster:

```
k get rabbitmqclusters.rabbitmq.com hello-world
```

If all went well, you'll see True for both ALLREPLICASREADY and RECONCILESUCCESS:
```
NAME          ALLREPLICASREADY   RECONCILESUCCESS   AGE
hello-world   True               True               5m26s
```

Hooray! Your single RabbitMQ node is ready!

## üëØ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è The More the Merrier: Deploying a Multi-Node RabbitMQ Cluster
Now, let's crank things up a notch and deploy a cluster with multiple RabbitMQ nodes for better resilience and scalability. We'll use a configuration in the rmq.yaml file (make sure this file exists in your k8s directory):

```
kubectl apply -f rmq.yaml
```

Let's check the pods again to see our RabbitMQ gang:
```
kubectl  get pods
```
You should now see multiple pods starting with my-tanzu-rabbit-server-:
```
NAME                       READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
hello-world-server-0       1/1     Running   0          10m
my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0   1/1     Running   0          2m59s
my-tanzu-rabbit-server-1   1/1     Running   0          2m59s
my-tanzu-rabbit-server-2   1/1     Running   0          2m59s
```

Awesome! You've got a multi-node RabbitMQ cluster running on Kubernetes!

## üîå Superpowers Activated: Enabling RabbitMQ Plugins
RabbitMQ has tons of cool features packed into plugins. Let's enable some useful ones on one of our RabbitMQ servers (we'll target the first one, my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0):

```
kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 -- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_stream
kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 --rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_stream_management

kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 -- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_prometheus

kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 -- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel
kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 -- rabbitmq-plugins enable rabbitmq_shovel_management
```

These commands enable plugins for streams, stream management, Prometheus metrics, and the Shovel functionality. Think of it as giving your RabbitMQ server some extra tools in its belt!

## üë§üîë Setting Up Shop: Users and Permissions
To interact with our RabbitMQ cluster, we'll need a user with the right permissions. Let's create a user named arul with a password password (you should use something more secure in a real setup!) and give it administrator privileges:

```
kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 -- rabbitmqctl add_user arul password
kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 -- rabbitmqctl set_permissions  -p / arul ".*" ".*" ".*"
kubectl -n default exec my-tanzu-rabbit-server-0 -- rabbitmqctl set_user_tags arul administrator
```

This is like creating a key (arul/password) and giving it full access (".*" ".*" ".*") to the RabbitMQ kingdom (-p /).

## üïµÔ∏è‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Secret Agent: Fetching Default Credentials
The RabbitMQ Operator also creates a default user and password stored as a Kubernetes Secret. Let's grab those:

```
instance=my-tanzu-rabbit
username=$(kubectl -n default   get secret <span class="math-inline">\{instance\}\-default\-user \-o jsonpath\="\{\.data\.username\}" \| base64 \-\-decode\)
password\=</span>(kubectl -n default   get secret <span class="math-inline">\{instance\}\-default\-user \-o jsonpath\="\{\.data\.password\}" \| base64 \-\-decode\)
service\=</span>{instance}
echo $username
echo $password
```

This little script sniffs out the username and password from the Kubernetes Secret and prints them to your console. Handy for quick access!

## üñ•Ô∏è Peeking Inside: Accessing the RabbitMQ Management UI
Want a visual look at your RabbitMQ cluster? Let's use port-forward to access the management UI in your browser:

```
k port-forward svc/my-tanzu-rabbit 15672:15672
```

Now, point your browser to:

http://localhost:15672

You can log in using either the default credentials you just fetched or the arul/password user you created. Explore the UI ‚Äì it's like the cockpit of your RabbitMQ spaceship!

## üöÄ Putting it to the Test: Deploying Producers and Consumers with PerfTest
Time to see our RabbitMQ cluster in action! We'll use the rabbitmq-perf-test tool running as Kubernetes Jobs to simulate message producers and consumers.

### üß™ PerfTest on K8s: Quorum Queues
Let's run some performance tests with standard and quorum queues (a more robust queue type):

```
kubectl -n default  --restart=Never run sa-workshop --image=pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test -- --uri "amqp://${username}:${password}@${service}" --producers 10 --consumers 5 --predeclared --routing-key "sa-workshop" --pmessages 1000 --queue "sa-workshop" --rate 100 --consumer-rate 10 --multi-ack-every 10

kubectl -n default  --restart=Never run sa-workshop-quorum --image=pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test -- --uri "amqp://${username}:${password}@${service}" --quorum-queue --producers 10 --consumers 5 --predeclared --routing-key "sa-workshop-quorum" --pmessages 1000 --queue "sa-workshop-quorum" --rate 100 --consumer-rate 10 --multi-ack-every 10

kubectl -n default  --restart=Always run arul-perf2 --image=pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test -- --uri "amqp://${username}:${password}@${service}" -i 120 -u "q.sys.synthetic-health-check" -qq -P 5 -ms -b 20 -hst 4 -dcr -c 1 -q 5
```

These commands launch Kubernetes Jobs that will send and receive messages to queues named sa-workshop and sa-workshop-quorum. Keep an eye on your RabbitMQ Management UI to see the queues and message flow!


--uri "amqp://${username}:${password}@${service}": This is an argument passed to the perf-test tool, specifying the AMQP URI to connect to the RabbitMQ server.
amqp://: The AMQP protocol.
${username}: A variable representing the username for connecting to RabbitMQ (likely fetched from a Kubernetes Secret in the full context).
${password}: A variable representing the password for connecting to RabbitMQ (also likely from a Secret).
${service}: A variable representing the hostname or service name of the RabbitMQ service within the Kubernetes cluster. This allows the perf-test container to find the RabbitMQ instance within the rmq-network.
--producers 10: This tells perf-test to simulate 10 message producer clients. These clients will connect to the RabbitMQ server and publish messages.
--consumers 5: This tells perf-test to simulate 5 message consumer clients. These clients will connect to the RabbitMQ server and consume messages from the specified queue.
--predeclared: This flag indicates that the target exchange and queue already exist on the RabbitMQ server. perf-test will not attempt to declare them.
--routing-key "<routing-key>": This specifies the routing key that the producers will use when publishing messages to an exchange (in this case, implicitly the default exchange as no exchange is specified). Consumers will bind to the queue with this routing key (again, implicitly with the default exchange).
"sa-workshop" in the first command.
"sa-workshop-quorum" in the second command.
--pmessages 1000: This tells each producer to publish a total of 1000 persistent messages.
--queue "<queue-name>": This specifies the name of the queue that the producers will publish to (via the default exchange and the specified routing key) and that the consumers will consume from.
"sa-workshop" in the first command.
"sa-workshop-quorum" in the second command.
--rate 100: This sets the target publishing rate for each producer to 100 messages per second.
--consumer-rate 10: This sets the target consumption rate for each consumer to 10 messages per second.
--multi-ack-every 10: This tells the consumers to send a multiple acknowledgement (ack) for every 10 messages received, rather than acknowledging each message individually. This can improve performance in some scenarios.

### üåä PerfTest on K8s: Streams
And let's try out the RabbitMQ Streams functionality we enabled earlier:

```
kubectl -n default  --restart=Always run stream --image=pivotalrabbitmq/perf-test -- --uri "amqp://<span class="math-inline">\{username\}\:</span>{password}@${service}" --stream-queue --producers 10 --consumers 5 --predeclared --routing-key "sa-workshop-stream" --pmessages 100 --queue "sa-workshop-stream" --rate 100 --consumer-rate 10 --multi-ack-every 1 -c 10
```

This command will run a continuous performance test using a RabbitMQ Stream queue. Streams offer different messaging semantics compared to traditional queues.
